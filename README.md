# Ryndenfall
Ryndenfall is a text-based, choice-driven, adventure RPG with turn-based fighting elements! 


## Setting
Ryndenfall takes place in the world of Veraxia, a fantasy-styled world full of magical beings and mystical properties. In Veraxia, lies 4 nations: The Ayrsandria Empire, The Kingdom of Lieandral, The Kincerpent Shogunate, and the Kingdom of Morterra. A prophecy that was foretold centuries ago is finally coming to fruition, as an ancient evil has risen and is enforcing her will onto Veraxia. His first goal? Encase the world in total darkness (You know, the usual). In the chaos, war is now raging between nations and it is now up to an unlikely group of individuals to unite the 4 nations against their one common enemy, before the whole world succumbs to an eternal night.


## Gameplay
In Ryndenfall, the user will be able to create their very own character. They can choose which nation they hail from, which will affect their class, their stats, their weapon choice, as well as how citizens of certain nations will interact with them. Ryndenfall is very story-driven, which will carry dialogue and will allow the user to choose certain dialogue/interaction options when progressing through the game. Combat will be turn based and the actions the user can take will differ depending on their weapons and classes.
